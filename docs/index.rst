pyScss is a Python implementation of `Sass`_, a CSS preprocessing language that
adds variables, expressions, nested rules, mixins, inheritance, and other
features that help ease the maintenance of large stylesheets.

.. _Sass: http://sass-lang.com/

pyScss also includes support for Compass, and has an extension mechanism for
adding your own custom behavior.

pyScss is not yet fully compatible with the canonical Ruby implementation, but
we're getting there and constantly improving.  Please feel free to `file a
GitHub issue`_ for anything pyScss gets wrong.
